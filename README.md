My first semester project for my front-end development studies at Noroff.

## Description

We were tasked with building a web site for a science museum that should be informative and appealing. The copy and some of the images were provided by Noroff.

Requirements:

- 4-6 pages
- Responsive
- Quick to download
- Should take WCAG principles into consideration

This was the first project I sat down to develop from design to functional site. I'm pleased with how the site looks, and i believe the images, colors and compoisition is fitting for the target audience, school kids and their parents.

I would go somewhat differently in my use of lines to separate sections of the page, especially on smaller devices, to see if this could reduce the amount of noise. I would also work to make it somewhat less boxy.

The code is not optimal, but there was a lot of lessons learned in terms of organizing code and thinking about reusability in CSS.
