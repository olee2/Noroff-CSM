          Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, 
          explores the night sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ll locate the various constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators 
          who used the stars to travel by.

          Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time.

        <p>
          You can also take some time to meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, 
          including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.

        <h3>Biology and Medicine</h3>
        <p class="margin-bottom-16px">
          From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are 
          offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the tiny world. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, 
          but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

        <h3>Ecology</h3>
        <p class="margin-bottom-16px">
          As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, 
          the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable 
          future not just for humans but for the whole planet.
        </p>
        <p>
          In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face including global warming, 
          extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.
